# Example Chapter10_08a
# Parallel SRAM and Computing 100,001 Digits of Pi

This advanced example extends RAM even further with a
2MByte parallel SRAM brick to calculate
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=100,001">
decimal digits of the mathematical
constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi">.

This example requires utmost attention to detail and advanced
laboratory and programming skills to make programmatic access
to an external 2MByte parallel SRAM brick as, let's say,
_easy_ _as_ _pie_.
