# Example Chapter12_04
# Floating-Point Calculations

Example chapter12_04 float performs a variety of floating-point
calculations of selected special functions of pure and applied
mathematics.

# Selected Special Functions

Special functions such as the gamma function, Bessel functions,
Legendre functions, zeta-type functions and many others
are essential in pure and applied mathematics.
Special functions are _special_ in the sense of generally
being considered more specialized than elementary
transecndental functions like trigonometric functions,
logarithmic functions, exponential functions and the like.

Many special functions, although very difficult to calculate
over wide parameter and argument ranges have remarkably
simple small-argument approximations such as Taylor series.

and complex-valued order
