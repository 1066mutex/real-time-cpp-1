# Example Chapter10_08
# External SPI RAM and Computing 10,001 Digits of Pi

This advanced example extends available RAM via SPI SRAM chips
and uses a Pi Spigot algorithm to compute
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10,001">
decimal digits
of the mathematical
constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi">,
showing fascinating memory management iterators,
containers and algorithms along the way.

This example depicts algorithmic complexity running in a real-world system
and highlights the real-time numeric expression of the detailed description
of algorithmic complexity in the corresponding book section.
