# Example Chapter16_08
# Generating and displaying 128-bit Random Prime Numbers

This advanced example uses an extended integer class
to create 128-bit random unsigned prime integers with
primality testing performed via Miller-Rabin.

This example also provides fascinating, intuitive,
visual insight into the prime number theory
of pure mathematics.
