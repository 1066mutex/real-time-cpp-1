## Code Snippets

Each code snippet in intended to be a complete standalone
C++ project that compiles and runs on a PC. The code
snippets correspond to individual code samples in the
book but extend these in rudimentary ways to include
a main subroutine and usually some sensible short messages
to the output console.
