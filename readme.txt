Companion Code for Real-Time C++.

The reference project supports:
  ATMEL(R) AVR(R) Atmega328P,
  Win32 in Release and Debug
  ST microelectronics(R) STM32F10x ARM(R) Cortex(TM)-M3

Cross-development is used in combination with
Microsoft(R) Visual Studio(R) 2012.

In Visual Studio(R) 2012, open the solution
ref_app.sln. Select the desired configuration,
and rebuild all. The build results are placed
in the bin directory.

There is also a workspace solution for
ATMEL(R) Atmel Studio(R) 6. It is called
ref_app.atsln.

GCC ports for the microcontroller solutions
are available in the directory:
  ref_app/tools/Util/MinGW/msys/1.0/local/*

These compilers have been built in MinGW and
moved to the solution.
